CainCamera is an open-source comprehensive app that includes functions such as 
beauty camera, photo editing, and short video editing. 
The project was created to learn how to implement real-time beauty, 
dynamic filters, dynamic stickers, makeup, taking pictures, short video segment recording and deletion,
photo editing, short video editing, and synthesis functions.

As of now, the implemented functions include:

Beauty Camera

Dynamic filters
Dynamic stickers
Taking pictures, short video segment recording and deletion
Thin face, big eyes, brighten eyes, and teeth whitening beauty processing

Note that the makeup function is still under development, and the non-linear editing SDK is currently being developed.

CainCamera also includes several libraries, such as cameralibrary, facedetectlibrary,
filterlibrary, imagelibrary, landmarklibrary, and medialibrary. The facedetectlibrary uses Face++ SDK for face landmark detection.
